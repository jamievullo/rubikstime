- Kelley: ok so timer component renders on home page. hitting start session will set up listening event and listen for space press to start and stop timer. Hitting Enter key/Return key will reset timer back to 0 but leave the listening event on. Also a button to stop session or remove listening event. Maybe like green light or red lights? wOrK iN pRoGrEs. <3
