- Kelley: ok so timer component renders on home page. hitting start session will set up listening event and listen for space press to start and stop timer. Hitting Enter key/Return key will reset timer back to 0 but leave the listening event on. Also a button to stop session or remove listening event. Maybe like green light or red lights? wOrK iN pRoGrEs. <3

- Kirk: ok so centiseconds isn't a thing. Changed it. Added images for cube selection. Those pesky CSS borg are playing with my mind somehow. Possibly telepathically. Is there a max on media queries for one element? We may never know.
